              ReadingBat.com is a faster-son effort by Paul and Matthew Ambrose to make learning how to program 
              a little easier.

              (so much so, that we shamelessly copied its look and feel). However, we observed
              that students often start using it to write code, prior to being equipped
              with the skill of reading code. It is difficult to write code without first learning 
              how to read and follow code! So we set out to create ReadingBat.com, which attempts 
              to get students comfortable reading code challenges and learning coding idioms. Once a student
              is comfortable with reading code, they can head straight for
